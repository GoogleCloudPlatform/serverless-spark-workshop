- City            - city in which product is to be delivered.
- State           - state in which product is to be delivered.
- PinCode         - pincode of the city in which product is to be delivered.
- ItemCode        - itemcode of the purchased product.
- ItemDescription - description of the item purchased.
- ItemPrice       - price of the purchased item.
- ItemQty         - quantity of the item purchased.

## 3. Declaring cloud shell variables

#### 3.1 Set the PROJECT_ID in Cloud Shell

Open Cloud shell or navigate to [shell.cloud.google.com](https://shell.cloud.google.com)<br>
Run the below
```
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

```

#### 3.2 Verify the PROJECT_ID in Cloud Shell

Next, run the following command in cloud shell to ensure that the current project is set correctly:

```
gcloud config get-value project
```

#### 3.3 Declare the variables

Based on the prereqs and checklist, declare the following variables in cloud shell by replacing with your values:


```
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)       #current GCP project where we are building our use case
REGION=                                             #GCP region where all our resources will be created
SUBNET=                                             #subnet which has private google access enabled
BUCKET_CODE=                                        #GCP bucket where our code, data and model files will be stored
BUCKET_PHS=                                         #bucket where our application logs created in the history server will be stored
HISTORY_SERVER_NAME=                                #name of the history server which will store our application logs
BQ_DATASET_NAME=                                    #BigQuery dataset where all the tables will be stored
UMSA=serverless-spark                               #name of the user managed service account required for the PySpark job executions
SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$UMSA@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
NAME=                                               #Your unique identifier
```

**Note:** For all the variables except 'NAME', please ensure to use the values provided by the admin team.

<br>



### 3.4 Update Cloud Shell SDK version
Run the below on cloud shell-
```
gcloud components update
```


## 4. Execution 


#### 4.1. Run PySpark Serverless Batch

Run the below on cloud shell -
```
gcloud dataproc batches submit \
  --project $PROJECT_ID \
  --region $REGION \
  pyspark --batch $NAME-batch-${RANDOM} \
  gs://$BUCKET_CODE/serverless_spark_streaming/00-scripts/spark_streaming_invoice.py  \
  --jars gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-with-dependencies_2.12-0.22.2.jar \
  --subnet $SUBNET \
  --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
  --history-server-cluster projects/$PROJECT_ID/regions/$REGION/clusters/$HISTORY_SERVER_NAME \
  -- $PROJECT_ID $BQ_DATASET_NAME $BUCKET_CODE $NAME
```

<br>

Once the job starts executing and the job is in running state , copy the data files one by one from serverless_spark_streaming/01-datasets/data_files  to  /serverless_spark_streaming/01-datasets/streaming_data/ for the streaming job to pick the files  and process them.

For copying the files open new cloud shell and declare the following variables and Run the following commands.

#### 4.2.1 Declare the variables

```
BUCKET_CODE=                                        #GCP bucket where our code, data and model files will be stored

```

#### 4.2.2 Command to copy Files.

```
gsutil cp gs://$BUCKET_CODE/serverless_spark_streaming/01-datasets/data_files/<<file_name>>  gs://$BUCKET_CODE/serverless_spark_streaming/01-datasets/streaming_data/

```

Note :
- **<<file_name>>**: Provide the file names one by one.

<br>


#### 4.2.3 Check the output table in BigQuery

Navigate to BigQuery Console, and check the **serverless spark streaming** dataset. <br>
As the files get processed, one new table '<your_name_here>_invoicedata' will be created and the data will be inserted into this table:

To view the data in these tables -

* Select the table from BigQuery Explorer by navigating 'project_id' **>** 'dataset' **>** 'table_name'
* Click on the **Preview** button to see the data in the table

<br>

**Note:** If the **Preview** button is not visible, run the below queries to view the data. However, these queries will be charged for the full table scan.
<br>

To query the data and view all the data, run the following query - 

```
 select * from `<GCP-PROJECT-NAME>.<BQ-DATASET-NAME>.<user_name>_invoicedata` 
```

**Note:** Edit the occurrence of <GCP-PROJECT-NAME> and <BQ-DATASET-NAME> to match the values of the variables PROJECT_ID,user_name and BQ_DATASET_NAME respectively

<kbd>
<img src=/images/bq1.png />
</kbd>

<br>

<br>
To find the count of data, run the following query - 

```
  select count(*) as count from `<GCP-PROJECT-NAME>.<BQ-DATASET-NAME>.<user_name>_invoicedata`
```

**Note:** Edit all occurrences of <GCP-PROJECT-NAME> and <BQ-DATASET-NAME> to match the values of the variables PROJECT_ID,user_name and BQ_DATASET_NAME respectively

<img src=/images/bq2.png />
</kbd>

<br>

<br>

<br>

## 4.3  Stop the Serverless Batch.

For stopping the serverless batch open new gcloud shell and  Declare the following variables and Run the following command.

#### 4.3.1 Declare variables

```
BATCH_ID =                                        # Batch Id of the batch running.
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)       #current GCP project where we are building our use case
REGION=                                             #GCP region where all our resources will be created
```

#### 4.3.2 Command to stop the batch

Run the following command in gcloud shell-

```
gcloud dataproc batches cancel $BATCH_ID \
--project=$PROJECT_ID \
--region=$REGION
```

## 5. Logging

#### 5.1 Serverless Batch logs

Logs associated with the application can be found in the logging console under 
**Dataproc > Serverless > Batches > <batch_name>**. 
<br> You can also click on “View Logs” button on the Dataproc batches monitoring page to get to the logging page for the specific Spark job.
