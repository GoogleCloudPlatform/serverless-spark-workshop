- rerror_rate - % of connections that have REJ errors
- srv_rerror_rate - % of connections that have REJ errors
- same_srv_rate - % of connections to the same service
- diff_srv_rate - % of connections to different services
- srv_diff_host_rate - % of connections to different hosts
- dst_host_count - Number of connections having the same destination host IP address.
- dst_host_srv_count - Number of connections having the same port number.
- dst_host_same_srv_rate - % of connections that were to the same service, among the connections aggregated in dst_host_count
- dst_host_diff_srv_rate - % of connections that were to different services, among the connections aggregated in dst_host_count
- dst_host_same_src_port_rate - % of connections that were to the same source port, among the connections aggregated in dst_host_srv_count
- dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate - % of connections that were to different destination machines, among the connections aggregated in dst_host_srv_count
- dst_host_serror_rate - % of connections that have activated the flag (4) s0, s1, s2 or s3, among the connections aggregated in dst_host_count
- dst_host_srv_serror_rate - % of connections that have activated the flag (4) s0, s1, s2 or s3, among the connections aggregated in dst_host_srv_count
- dst_host_rerror_rate  - % of connections that have activated the flag (4) REJ, among the connections aggregated in dst_host_count
- dst_host_srv_rerror_rate - of connections that have activated the flag (4) REJ, among the connections aggregated in dst_host_srv_count
- class - good or bad connection


**Note:** The following features refer to these same-host connections.

- serror_rate
- rerror_rate
- same_srv_rate
- diff_srv_rate
- srv_count

**Note:** The following features refer to these same-service connections.
- srv_serror_rate
- srv_rerror_rate
- srv_diff_host_rate

**Model Pipeline**

The model pipeline involves the following steps: <br>
	- Create buckets in GCS <br>
	- Create Dataproc and Persistent History Server Cluster <br>
	- Copy the raw data files, PySpark and notebook files into GCS <br>
	- Create a Cloud Composer environment and Airflow jobs to run the serverless spark job <br>
	- Creating Google BigQuery tables  <br>

<br>

## 3. Uploading DAG files to DAGs folder

* From the code repository, download the file located at: **malware_detection**>**00-scripts**>**malware_detection_airflow.py**
* Rename file to <your_name_here>-malware_detection_airflow.py
* Open the file and replace your name on row 21
* Navigate to **Composer**>**<composer_environment>**
* Next, navigate to **Environment Configuration**>**DAGs folder URI**
* Next, upload the DAG file to the GCS bucket corresponding to the **DAGs folder URI**

## 4. Execution of Airflow DAG

* Navigate to **Composer**>**<your_environment>**>**Open Airflow UI**

<kbd>
<img src=../images/composer_5.png />
</kbd>

<br>

* Once the Airflow UI opens, navigate to **DAGs** and open your respective DAG
* Next, trigger your DAG by clicking on the **Trigger DAG** button

<kbd>
<img src=../images/composer_6.png />
</kbd>

<br>

* Once the DAG is triggered, the DAG can be monitored directly through the Airflow UI as well as the Dataproc>Serverless>Batches window

<br>

## 5. BQ output tables

Navigate to BigQuery Console, and check the **malware_detection** dataset. <br>
Once the Airflow DAG execution is completed, three new tables '<your_name_here>_network_traffic_data', '<your_name_here>_model_test_output' and '<your_name_here>_model_eval_output' are created.

To view the data in this table -

* Select the table from BigQuery Explorer by navigating 'project_id' **>** 'dataset' **>** 'table_name'
* Click on the **Preview** button to see the data in the table

<br>

</kbd>

<br>

**Note:** If the **Preview** button is not visible, run the below queries to view the data. However, these queries will be charged for the full table scan.


### 1. Data Preparation Output

```
SELECT * FROM `<project_name>.<dataset_name>.<your_name_here>_network_traffic_data` LIMIT 1000

```

### 2. Model Training and Testing Output

```
  SELECT * FROM `<project_name>.<dataset_name>.<your_name_here>_model_test_output` LIMIT 1000;
```

### 3. Model Evaluation Output

```
  SELECT * FROM `<project_name>.<dataset_name>.<your_name_here>_model_eval_output` LIMIT 1000;
```

**Note:** Edit all occurrences of <project_name> and <dataset_name> to match the values of the variables PROJECT_ID, and BQ_DATASET_NAME respectively

## 6. Logging

### 6.1 Airflow logging

* To view the logs of any step of the DAG execution, click on the **<DAG step>**>**Log** button <br>

<br>

### 6.2 Serverless Batch logs

Logs associated with the application can be found in the logging console under
**Dataproc > Serverless > Batches > <batch_name>**.
<br> You can also click on “View Logs” button on the Dataproc batches monitoring page to get to the logging page for the specific Spark job.
