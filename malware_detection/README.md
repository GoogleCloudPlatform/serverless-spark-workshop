# Malware Detection using  Serverless Spark

Lab contributed by: [TEKsystems](https://www.teksystems.com/en/about-us/partnerships/google-cloud)

## Overview

With the advent of cloud environments, the concept of huge capital investments in infrastructure in terms of capital and maintenance is a thing of the past. Even when it comes to provisioning infrastructure on cloud services, it can get tedious and cumbersome.

In this example, you will look at executing a simple PySpark code which runs on Serverless batch (a fully managed Dataproc cluster). It is similar to executing code on a Dataproc cluster without the need to initialize, deploy or manage the underlying infrastructure.

This usecase is to perform Machine learning using serverless spark.


## 2. Services Used

* Google Cloud Storage
* Google Cloud Dataproc
* Google Cloud BigQuery
* Google Cloud Composer
* Airflow DAG



## 3. Permissions / IAM Roles required to run the lab

Following permissions / roles are required to execute the serverless batch

- Viewer
- Dataproc Editor
- BigQuery Data Editor
- Service Account User
- Storage Admin

<br>

## 4. Checklist
