## 1. Understanding data
The datasets used for this project are 


1. [Aisles data](../01-datasets/aisles/aisles.csv). <br>
2. [Departments data](../01-datasets/departments/departments.csv) . <br>
3. [Orders data](../01-datasets/orders/orders.csv). <br>
4. [Products data](../01-datasets/products/products.csv). <br>
5. [Order_products__prior](../01-datasets/order_products/order_products__prior.csv). <br>
6. [Order_products__train](../01-datasets/order_products/order_products__train.csv). <br>


- Aisles: This table includes all aisles. It has a single primary key (aisle_id)
- Departments: This table includes all departments. It has a single primary key (department_id)
- Products: This table includes all products. It has a single primary key (product_id)
- Orders: This table includes all orders, namely prior, train, and test. It has single primary key (order_id).
- Order_products_train: This table includes training orders. It has a composite primary key (order_id and product_id)
						and indicates whether a product in an order is a reorder or not (through the reordered variable).
- Order_products_prior : This table includes prior orders. It has a composite primary key (order_id and product_id) and
						indicates whether a product in an order is a reorder or not (through the reordered variable).

**Data Pipeline**

The data pipeline involves the following steps: <br>
	- Create buckets in GCS <br>
	- Create Dataproc and Persistent History Server Cluster <br>
	- Copy the raw data files, pyspark and notebook files into GCS <br>
	- Create a metastore service in Cloud Dataproc <br>
	- Create a Cloud Composer environment and Airflow jobs to orchestrate execution of Dataproc serverless batches <br>
	- Creating tables and writing data in Google BigQuery <br>

<br>

## 3. Uploading DAG files to DAGs folder

* From the code repository, download the file located at: **retail_store_analytics_metastore**>**00-scripts**>**retail-analytics-airflow.py**
* Rename file to <your_name_here>-retail-analytics-airflow.py
* Open the file and replace your name on row 37
* Navigate to **Composer**>**<composer_environment>**
* Next, navigate to **Environment Configuration**>**DAGs folder URI**
* Next, upload the DAG file to the GCS bucket corresponding to the **DAGs folder URI**

<br>


## 4. Execution of Airflow DAG

* Navigate to **Composer**>**<your_environment>**>**Open Airflow UI**

<kbd>
<img src=../images/composer_5.png />
</kbd>

<br>

* Once the Airflow UI opens, navigate to **DAGs** and open your respective DAG
* Next, trigger your DAG by clicking on the **Trigger DAG** button

<kbd>
<img src=../images/composer_6.png />
</kbd>

<br>

* Once the DAG is triggered, the DAG can be monitored directly through the Airflow UI as well as the Dataproc>Serverless>Batches window

## 5. BQ output tables

Navigate to BigQuery Console, and check the **retail_store_analytics** dataset. <br>
Once the Serverless batches execution is completed, three new table '<your_name_here>_inventory_data' , '<your_name_here>_suggested_aisles_data' and '<your_name_here>_sales_per_dow_per_departmentproduct' will be created:

<br>

<kbd>
<img src=../images/bigqueryretail.png />
</kbd>

<br>

To view the data in these tables -

* Select the table from BigQuery Explorer by navigating 'project_id' **>** 'dataset' **>** 'table_name'
* Click on the **Preview** button to see the data in the table

<br>

<kbd>
<img src=../images/bq_preview.png />
</kbd>

<br>

**Note:** If the **Preview** button is not visible, run the below queries to view the data. However, these queries will be charged for the full table scan.

```
  SELECT * FROM `<project_name>.<dataset_name>.<your_name_here>_inventory_data` LIMIT 1000;
  SELECT * FROM `<project_name>.<dataset_name>.<your_name_here>_suggested_aisles_data` LIMIT 1000;


```

</kbd>

<br>

**Note:** Edit all occurrences of <project_name> and <dataset_name> to match the values of the variables PROJECT_ID, and BQ_DATASET_NAME respectively

<br>

## 6. Logging

### 6.1 Airflow logging

* To view the logs of any step of the DAG execution, click on the **<DAG step>**>**Log** button <br>

<br>

### 6.2 Serverless Batch logs

Logs associated with the application can be found in the logging console under
**Dataproc > Serverless > Batches > <batch_name>**.
<br> You can also click on “View Logs” button on the Dataproc batches monitoring page to get to the logging page for the specific Spark job.
