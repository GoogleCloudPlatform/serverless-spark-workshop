# Daily covid data analysis with Serverless Spark Batch through Google Cloud Shell.

Following are the lab modules:

[1. Understanding Data](05a-daily-covid-data-analysis-gcloud-execution.md#1-understanding-the-data)<br>
[2. Solution Architecture](05a-daily-covid-data-analysis-gcloud-execution.md#2-solution-architecture)<br>
[3. Declaring Variables](05a-daily-covid-data-analysis-gcloud-execution.md#3-declaring-variables)<br>
[4. Running the job as a serverless batch on Dataproc](05a-daily-covid-data-analysis-gcloud-execution.md#4-running-the-job-as-a-serverless-batch-on-dataproc)<br>
[5. Logging](05a-daily-covid-data-analysis-gcloud-execution.md#5-logging)<br>

## 1. Understanding the data

The datasets used for this project are


1. [Confirmed data](../01-datasets/confirmed_df.csv) <br>
2. [Death data](../01-datasets/death_df.csv)<br>
3. [Latest data](../01-datasets/latest_data.csv)<br>
4. [US Medical data](../01-datasets/us_medical_data.csv)<br>


<br>

<br>
<br>

**Model Pipeline**

The model pipeline involves the following steps: <br>
	- Create buckets in GCS <br>
	- Create Dataproc and Persistent History Server Cluster <br>
	- Copy the raw data files, pyspark and notebook files into GCS <br>
	- Create a Cloud Composer environment and Airflow jobs to as Serverless spark job <br>

<br>


## 3. Declaring Variables

#### 3.1 Set the PROJECT_ID in Cloud Shell

Open Cloud shell or navigate to [shell.cloud.google.com](https://shell.cloud.google.com)<br>
Run the below
```
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

```

####  3.2 Verify the PROJECT_ID in Cloud Shell

Next, run the following command in cloud shell to ensure that the current project is set correctly:

```
gcloud config get-value project
```

####  3.3 Declare the variables

Based on the prereqs and checklist, declare the following variables in cloud shell by replacing with your values:


```
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)       #current GCP project where we are building our use case
REGION=                                             #GCP region where all our resources will be created
SUBNET=                                             #subnet which has private google access enabled
BUCKET_CODE=                                        #GCP bucket where our code, data and model files will be stored
BUCKET_PHS=                                         #bucket where our application logs created in the history server will be stored
HISTORY_SERVER_NAME=                                #name of the history server which will store our application logs
UMSA=serverless-spark                               #name of the user managed service account required for the PySpark job executions
SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$UMSA@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
NAME=                                               #your name
```
### 3.4 Update Cloud Shell SDK version

Run the below on cloud shell-

```
gcloud components update

```

## 4.  Running the job as a serverless batch on Dataproc

* Execute the following gcloud commands in cloud shell in the given order to execute daily-covid-data-analysis python file.


```
gcloud dataproc batches submit \
--project $PROJECT_ID \
--region $REGION pyspark \
--version 1.1 \
--batch $NAME-daily-covid-data-analysis-$RANDOM \
gs://$BUCKET_CODE/daily-covid-data-analysis/00-scripts/covid.py \
--subnet $SUBNET \
--service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
--history-server-cluster projects/$PROJECT_ID/regions/$REGION/clusters/$HISTORY_SERVER_NAME \
-- $BUCKET_CODE

```

## 5. Logging

### 5.1 Serverless Batch logs

Logs associated with the application can be found in the logging console under
**Dataproc > Serverless > Batches > <batch_name>**.
<br> You can also click on “View Logs” button on the Dataproc batches monitoring page to get to the logging page for the specific Spark job.
