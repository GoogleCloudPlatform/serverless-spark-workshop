# Daily covid data analysis with Serverless Spark Batch through Google cloud console.

Following are the lab modules:

[1. Understanding Data](05b-daily-covid-data-analysis-console-execution.md#1-understanding-the-data)<br>
[2. Solution Architecture](05b-daily-covid-data-analysis-console-execution.md#2-solution-architecture)<br>
[3. Create a new serverless batch on Dataproc](05b-daily-covid-data-analysis-console-execution.md#3-create-a-new-serverless-batch-on-dataproc)<br>
[4. Logging](05b-daily-covid-data-analysis-console-execution.md#4-logging)<br>

## 1. Understanding the data

The datasets used for this project are


1. [Confirmed data](../01-datasets/confirmed_df .csv). <br>
2. [Death data](../01-datasets/death_df.csv) . <br>
3. [Latest data](../01-datasets/latest_data.csv). <br>
4. [US Medical data](../01-datasets/us_medical_data.csv). <br>


<br>

## 2. Solution Architecture

<br>
<br>

**Model Pipeline**

The model pipeline involves the following steps: <br>
	- Create buckets in GCS <br>
	- Create Dataproc and Persistent History Server Cluster <br>
	- Copy the raw data files, pyspark and notebook files into GCS <br>
	- Create a Cloud Composer environment and Airflow jobs to as Serverless spark job <br>

<br>

## 3. Create a new serverless batch on Dataproc


Navigate to Dataproc > Serverless > Batches and click on **+CREATE**

Next, fill in the following values in the batch creation window :

- **Batch ID**   - A unique identifier for your batch
- **Region**     - The region name provided by the Admin team
- **Batch Type**    - PySpark
- **Runtime version** - 1.1
- **Main Python File** - gs://<your_code_bucket_name>/daily-covid-data-analysis/00-scripts/covid.py

<br>

<br>

- **Arguments** - <br>
  Four Arguments needs to be provided: <br>

    * <your_code_bucket_name>

  **Note:** Press RETURN after each argument <br>
  **Note:** The arguments must be passed in the same order as mentioned as they are extracted in the order they are provided

- **Service Account** - <UMSA_NAME>@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Network Configuration** - select the network and subnetwork with Private Google Access Enabled

<br>

- **History Server Cluster** - <your_phs_cluster_name>

<br>

<br>

Once all the details are in, you can submit the batch. As the batch starts, you can see the execution details and logs on the console.

<br>

## 4. Logging

### 4.1 Serverless Batch logs

Logs associated with the application can be found in the logging console under
**Dataproc > Serverless > Batches > <batch_name>**.
<br> You can also click on “View Logs” button on the Dataproc batches monitoring page to get to the logging page for the specific Spark job.
