# Top Words in Shakespeare Dataset


## 1. Overview

With the advent of cloud environments, the concept of huge capital investments in infrastructure in terms of capital and maintenance is a thing of the past. Even when it comes to provisioning infrastructure on cloud services, it can get tedious and cumbersome.
In this example, you will look at executing a simple PySpark code which runs on Serverless batch through Bigquery.

The Goal is to run PySpark code in Bigquery console. The code provided in the repo will calculate top words in the Shakespeare public BigQuery dataset and display the top 20 words.
