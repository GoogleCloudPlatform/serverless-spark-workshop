Following are the lab modules:

[1. Understanding Data](06a_timeseries_forecasting_vertex_ai_notebook_execution.md#1-understanding-data)<br>
[2. Solution Architecture](06a_timeseries_forecasting_vertex_ai_notebook_execution.md#2-solution-architecture)<br>
[3. Execution](06a_timeseries_forecasting_vertex_ai_notebook_execution.md#3-execution)<br>
[4. Logging](06a_timeseries_forecasting_vertex_ai_notebook_execution.md#4-logging)<br>

<br>

## 1. Understanding Data

## Data Files
The datasets used for this project are:

- train.csv: This file contains the date, store, item, sales data.

date - Date of the sale data. There are no holiday effects or store closures.<br>
store - Store ID<br>
item - Item ID<br>
sales - Number of items sold at a particular store on a particular date.<br>

- test.csv:

id- Unique identifier<br>
date - Date of the sale data. There are no holiday effects or store closures.<br>
store - Store ID<br>
item - Item ID

<br>

## 3. Execution

### 3.1. Run the Batch by creating session.

#### Creating Notebook in Vertex AI
Select Workbench from the left scroll bar of the Vertex AI main page.
Select the Managed Notebooks tab.
In the Managed Notebooks tab , click the New Notebook icon.

![This is a alt text.](..images/session6.png "Architectural Diagram.")

#### Next, fill in the following values in the Notebook creation window as shown in the images below:

- Note: Currently managed notebooks are only supported in: us-central1, us-west1, us-west4, northamerica-northeast1, southamerica-east1, europe-west1, europe-west4, asia-northeast1, asia-southeast1, asia-south1, asia-east2, australia-southeast1, asia-northeast3.
 
<br>

- **Notebook Name**   - A unique identifier for your Notebook
- **Region**     - The region name provided by the Admin team
- **Permission Type**    - Single User Only (Single user only mode restricts access to the specified user)

 * Provide a name and region to the notebook and select 'Single User Only' and click 'Create'. We will let the 'Advanced Settings' remain as the default values.

![This is a alt text.](../images/session7.png "Architectural Diagram.")


 * Once the notebook is running, click the 'OPEN JUPYTERLAB' option next to the Notebook name as shown below

 ![This is a alt text.](../images/session8.png)

* Follow the on screen instructions to launch the JupyterLab session

#### Create Serverless Spark Session

* Click on the File and the New launcher and select Serverless Spark

##  Follow the on screen instructions to create Session

### 3.2. Provide the details for the Session

Next, fill in the following values in the session creation window as shown in the images below:

- **Session Name**   - A unique identifier for your session
- **Region**     - The region name provided by the Admin team
- **Version**    - 1.1
- **Language**    - Pyspark
- **Autoshutdown** - 24 hours
- **Service Account** - <UMSA_NAME>@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Network Configuration** - Select the network and subnetwork provided by the Admin team
- **History Server Cluster** - projects/<PROJECT_ID>/regions/<REGION_NAME>/clusters/<HISTORY_SERVER_NAME>
- **Container**  - #GCP-REGION-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:1.0.1

* Click the **SUBMIT** button to create the session.

* Once the Session is created select 'No Kernel' from the kernel dropdown list and then delete the notebook

</kbd>

<br>

* Next, using the browser option from JupyterLab, navigate to the Notebook file located at: <br>
    <bucket_name> > 'timeseries_forecasting' > 00-scripts > timeseries_forecasting.ipynb
* From the kernel dropdown list, select the kernel for the session created in section 3.2
* Pass the values to the variables project_name, dataset_name, bucket_name as provided by the Admin and replace user_name by your username
* Next, hit the **Execute** button as shown below to run the code in the notebook.

### 3.3. Check the output table in BigQuery

Navigate to BigQuery Console, and check the **timeseries_forecasting** dataset. <br>
Once the code has successfully executed,  new table '<your_name_here>_global_predictions' will be created :

To query the data to find the list of stocks with highest stringency Index, run the following query -

```
  select * from `<GCP-PROJECT-NAME>.<BQ-DATASET-NAME>.<user_name>_global_predictions` 

```

**Note:** Edit all occurrences of <GCP-PROJECT-NAME> and <BQ-DATASET-NAME> to match the values of the variables PROJECT_ID,user_name and BQ_DATASET_NAME respectively

## 4. Logging


### 4.1 Persistent History Server logs

To view the Persistent History server logs, click the 'View History Server' button on the Sessions monitoring page and the logs will be shown as below:

As the session is still in active state , we will be able to find the logs in show incomplete applications.
