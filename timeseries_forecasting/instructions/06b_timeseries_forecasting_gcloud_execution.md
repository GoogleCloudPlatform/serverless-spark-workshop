Following are the lab modules:

[1. Understanding Data](06b_timeseries_forecasting_gcloud_execution.md#1-understanding-data)<br>
[2. Solution Architecture](06b_timeseries_forecasting_gcloud_execution.md#2-solution-architecture)<br>
[3. Declaring Variables](06b_timeseries_forecasting_gcloud_execution.md#3-declaring-cloud-shell-variables)<br>
[4. Execution](06b_timeseries_forecasting_gcloud_execution.md#4-execution)<br>
[5. Logging](06b_timeseries_forecasting_gcloud_execution.md#5-logging)<br>

## 1. Understanding Data

## Data Files

The datasets used for this project are:

- train.csv: This file contains the date, store, item, sales data.


date - Date of the sale data. There are no holiday effects or store closures<br>
store - Store ID<br>
item - Item ID<br>
sales - Number of items sold at a particular store on a particular date.<br>

- test.csv:

id- Unique identifier<br>
date - Date of the sale data. There are no holiday effects or store closures.<br>
store - Store ID<br>
item - Item ID<br>

<br>

## 2. Solution Architecture

## 3. Declaring cloud shell variables

#### 3.1 Set the PROJECT_ID in Cloud Shell

Open Cloud shell or navigate to [shell.cloud.google.com](https://shell.cloud.google.com)<br>
Run the below
```
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

```

#### 3.2 Verify the PROJECT_ID in Cloud Shell

Next, run the following command in cloud shell to ensure that the current project is set correctly:

```
gcloud config get-value project
```

#### 3.3 Declare the variables

Based on the prereqs and checklist, declare the following variables in cloud shell by replacing with your values:


```
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)       #current GCP project where we are building our use case
REGION=                                             #GCP region where all our resources will be created
SUBNET=                                             #subnet which has private google access enabled
BUCKET_CODE=                                        #GCP bucket where our code, data and model files will be stored
BUCKET_PHS=                                         #bucket where our application logs created in the history server will be stored
HISTORY_SERVER_NAME=                                #name of the history server which will store our application logs
BQ_DATASET_NAME=                                    #BigQuery dataset where all the tables will be stored
SESSION_NAME=                                       # Serverless Session name.
UMSA_NAME=                                          #user managed service account required for the PySpark job executions
SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$UMSA_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
NAME=                                               #Your unique identifier
```

**Note:** For all the variables except 'NAME', please ensure to use the values provided by the admin team.

<br>

### 3.4 Update Cloud Shell SDK version

Run the below on cloud shell-

```
gcloud components update

```


## 4. Execution


### 4.1. Run the Batch by creating sessions.

Run the below on cloud shell to create session. -
```
  gcloud beta dataproc sessions create spark $SESSION_NAME  \
--project=${PROJECT_ID} \
--location=${REGION} \
--version=1.1 \
--property=spark.jars=gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-with-dependencies_2.12-0.22.2.jar \
--history-server-cluster=projects/$PROJECT_ID/regions/$REGION/clusters/$HISTORY_SERVER_NAME \
--subnet=$SUBNET \
--property=dataproc:jupyter.notebook.gcs.dir=$BUCKET_CODE

```
<br>

* Once the serverless spark session has been created, open the session and click on the jupyter session.

<br>

* Select Pyspark Kernel for the execution.

<br>

</kbd>
<br>
<br>

* Copy the code from 00-scripts/timeseries_forecasting.py into the notebook created and edit the variables: project_name,dataset_name,bucket_name and name with your values and hit the **Execute** button to execute the code

<br>
<br>


### 4.2. Check the output table in BigQuery

Navigate to BigQuery Console, and check the **timeseries_forecasting** dataset. <br>
Once the code has successfully executed, four new tables '<your_name_here>_global_predictions' will be created :

To query the data to find the list of stocks with highest stringency Index, run the following query -
```
  select * from `<GCP-PROJECT-NAME>.<BQ-DATASET-NAME>.<user_name>_global_predictions`

```

**Note:** Edit all occurrences of <GCP-PROJECT-NAME> and <BQ-DATASET-NAME> to match the values of the variables PROJECT_ID,user_name and BQ_DATASET_NAME respectively

## 5. Logging


### 5.1 Persistent History Server logs

To view the Persistent History server logs, click the 'View History Server' button on the Sessions monitoring page and the logs will be shown as below:

As the session is still in active state , we will be able to find the logs in show incomplete applications.
