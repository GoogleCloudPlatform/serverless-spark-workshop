# Serverless Spark HackFest

Apache Spark is often used for interactive queries, machine learning, and real-time workloads.<br>

Spark developers are typically spending only 40% of time writing code while spending 60% tuning infrastructure and managing clusters.<br>

Google Cloud customers have used our auto-scaling, serverless Spark to boost productivity and reduce infrastructure costs.<br>

This repo contains hands-on labs for [Serverless Spark on GCP use cases](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/spark) for data engineers and data scientists.

### Quotes From Serverless Spark Users
- "Serverless Spark is so much easier than traditional cluster based products."<br> 
~ Director of Data Science at business management corporation<br><br>
- "Anytime we can go the serverless route we will.  Just so much simpler and eliminates the management of the infrastructure."<br>
~ Director of Data Engineering at business management corporation<br><br>
- “Serverless Spark enables us to only use the compute resources we need when we need them and all with a single click.  The Spark HackFest is a great way to get hands on experience with the tools.”<br> 
~ Principal Data Scientist at multinational retail corporation<br><br>
- “We ran a compute-intensive Serverless Spark query in 19 mins.  That same Spark query took 90 mins on a traditional cluster based product.  It's ~80% faster on Serverless Spark.”<br> 
~ Principal Architect at multinational retail corporation
