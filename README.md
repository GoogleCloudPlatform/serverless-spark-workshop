# Serverless Spark Solution Accelerators

Apache Spark is often used for interactive queries, machine learning, and real-time workloads.<br>

Spark developers are typically spending only 40% of time writing code while spending 60% tuning infrastructure and managing clusters.  There's a better way.<br>

Google Cloud customers have used our auto-scaling, serverless Spark to boost productivity and reduce infrastructure costs.<br>

This repository contains Serverless Spark on GCP solution accelerators built around common use cases - helping data engineers and data scientists with Apache Spark experience ramp up faster on [Serverless Spark on GCP](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs).<br>


# Feedback From Serverless Spark Users
- "Our use case is to optimize retail assortment from 500M+ items.  Serverless Spark enables us to only use the compute resources when we need them and all with a single click."<br>
~ Dataproc customer who set up these production pipelines in one week<br><br>

- “Job that took 90 minutes on a manually tuned cluster took 19 minutes to finish with Serverless Spark.  Every new data pipeline will start on Serverless Spark.”<br>
~ Principal Architect at multinational retail corporation
