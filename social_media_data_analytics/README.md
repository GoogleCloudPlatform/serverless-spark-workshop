# Social Media Data Analysis using Vertex AI and Serverless Spark

## Overview

With the advent of cloud environments, the concept of huge capital investments in infrastructure in terms of capital and maintenance is a thing of the past. Even when it comes to provisioning infrastructure on cloud services, it can get tedious and cumbersome.

In this example, you will look at executing a simple PySpark code which runs on Serverless batch (a fully managed Dataproc cluster). It is similar to executing code on a Dataproc cluster without the need to initialize, deploy or manage the underlying infrastructure.<br>

This repository processes tweets data using spark and finds out most popular trending #tags, 
plots a bar graph for the types of tweets and 
their followers count and also plots a map about the origin of the tweets. 

## Services Used
* Google Cloud Storage
* Google Cloud Dataproc
* Google Cloud VertexAI

## 3. Permissions / IAM Roles required to run the lab

Following permissions / roles are required to execute the serverless batch

- Viewer
- Dataproc Editor
- Service Account User
- Storage Admin
- Notebooks Runner

## 5. Lab Modules

The lab consists of the following modules.

1. Understand the Data
2. Solution Architecture
3. Executing ETL
4. Examine the logs
5. Explore the output

There is one way of performing the lab.
- Using [GCP sessions through Vertex AI](instructions/05-social-media-data-analytics-vertex-ai-notebook-execution.md)

<br>

## 6. CleanUp

Delete the resources after finishing the lab. <br>
