# Customer Churn using Vertex AI

**Goal** -  Data Preparation and Model Training for Detecting Customer Churn.

Following are the lab modules:

[1. Understanding Data](instructions/05a_customer_churn_vertex_ai_notebook_execution.md#1-understanding-data)<br>
[2. Solution Architecture](instructions/05a_customer_churn_vertex_ai_notebook_execution.md#2-solution-architecture)<br>
[3. Execution](instructions/05a_customer_churn_vertex_ai_notebook_execution.md#3-execution)<br>
[4. Check the output table in BQ](instructions/05a_customer_churn_vertex_ai_notebook_execution.md#4-check-the-output-table-in-bq)<br>
[5. Logging](instructions/05a_customer_churn_vertex_ai_notebook_execution.md#5-logging)<br>

<br>

## 1. Understanding Data

The dataset used for this project is [customer churn data](01-datasets/customer_churn_train_data.csv) and [customer test data](01-datasets/customer_churn_test_data.csv).. <br>

The dataset contains the following features:

- Churn - Binary field which represents customers who left/were retained within the last month
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

**Note:** The following features refer to these same-host connections.

- serror_rate
- rerror_rate
- same_srv_rate
- diff_srv_rate
- srv_count

**Note:** The following features refer to these same-service connections.
- srv_serror_rate
- srv_rerror_rate
- srv_diff_host_rate

<br>

**Model Pipeline**

The model pipeline involves the following steps:
 - Data cleanup and preparation
 - Building and training a Machine Learning Model (Random Forest Classifier) before saving it into a GCS bucket
 - Using the model built in above step to evaluate test data

<br>

## 3. Execution

### 3.1. Run the Batch by creating session.

#### Creating Notebook in Vertex AI
Select Workbench from the left scroll bar of the Vertex AI main page.
Select the Managed Notebooks tab.
In the Managed Notebooks tab , click the New Notebook icon.

![This is a alt text.](../images/session6.png "Architectural Diagram.")

#### Next, fill in the following values in the Notebook creation window as shown in the images below:

- **Notebook Name**   - A unique identifier for your Notebook
- **Region**     - The region name provided by the Admin team
- **Permission Type**    - Service Account

 * Provide a name and region to the notebook and select 'Service Account' and click 'Create'. We will let the 'Advanced Settings' remain as the default values.

![This is a alt text.](../images/session7.png "Architectural Diagram.")


 * Once the notebook is running, click the 'OPEN JUPYTERLAB' option next to the Notebook name as shown below

 ![This is a alt text.](../images/session8.png)

* Follow the on screen instructions to launch the JupyterLab session

#### Create Serverless Spark Session

* Click on the File and the New launcher and select Serverless Spark

##  Follow the on screen instructions to create Session

### 3.2. Provide the details for the Session

Next, fill in the following values in the session creation window as shown in the images below:

- **Session Name**   - A unique identifier for your session
- **Region**     - The region name provided by the Admin team
- **Language**    - Pyspark
- **Version**     - 1.1
- **Autoshutdown** - 24 hours
- **Service Account** - <UMSA_NAME>@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- **Network Configuration** - Select the network and subnetwork provided by the Admin team
- **History Server Cluster** - projects/<PROJECT_ID>/regions/<REGION_NAME>/clusters/<HISTORY_SERVER_NAME>
- **Properties** - spark.jars=gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-with-dependencies_2.12-0.22.2.jar

* Click the **SUBMIT** button to create the session.

</kbd><br>


* Once the Session is created select 'No Kernel' from the kernel dropdown list and then delete the notebook

<kbd>

</kbd>

<br>

* Next, using the browser option from JupyterLab, navigate to the Notebook file located at: <br>
    <bucket_name> > 'customer-churn-prediction-vertex-ai' > 00-scripts > customer_churn.ipynb
* From the kernel dropdown list, select the kernel for the session created in section 3.2
* Pass the values to the variables project_name, dataset_name, bucket_name as provided by the Admin and replace user_name by your username
* Next, hit the **Execute** button as shown below to run the code in the notebook.

### 4. Check the output table in BQ

Navigate to BigQuery Console, and check the **customer_churn** dataset. <br>
Once the code execution is completed, four new tables '<your_name_here>_train_data', '<your_name_here>_test_data', '<your_name_here>_predictions_data' and '<your_name_here>_test_output' will be created as shown below :

To view the data in these tables -

* Select the table from BigQuery Explorer by navigating 'project_id' **>** 'dataset' **>** 'table_name'
* Click on the **Preview** button to see the data in the table

<br>

<kbd>
<img src=../images/bq_preview.png />
</kbd>

<br>

**Note:** If the **Preview** button is not visible, run the below queries to view the data. However, these queries will be charged for the full table scan.

```
  SELECT * FROM `<project_name>.<dataset_name>.<your_name_here>_train_data` LIMIT 1000
  SELECT * FROM `<project_name>.<dataset_name>.<your_name_here>_test_data` LIMIT 1000
  SELECT * FROM `<project_name>.<dataset_name>.<your_name_here>_predictions_data` LIMIT 1000
  SELECT * FROM `<project_name>.<dataset_name>.<your_name_here>_test_output` LIMIT 1000
```

**Note:** Edit all occurrences of <project_name> and <dataset_name> to match the values of the variables PROJECT_ID, and BQ_DATASET_NAME respectively

## 5. Logging


### 5.1 Persistent History Server logs

To view the Persistent History server logs, click the 'View History Server' button on the Sessions monitoring page and the logs will be shown as below:

As the session is still in active state , we will be able to find the logs in show incomplete applications.
