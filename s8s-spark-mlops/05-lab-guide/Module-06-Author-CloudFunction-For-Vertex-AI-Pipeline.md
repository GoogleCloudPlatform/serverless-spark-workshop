# About Module 6

In this module we will create a Cloud Function that executes a Vertex AI pipeline on-demand based off of a pipeline JSON in GCS. This module takes 15 minutes to review, and almost an hour to run.

## 1. Where we are in the model training lifecycle

## 2. The lab environment

## 3. The exercise

## 4. Dependencies

1. Successful testing of pipeline template JSON
2. Customized Vertex AI Spark ML model training template JSON in GCS

We completed #1 in the prior module. #2 is already available for you in GCS.

## 5. Documentation for scheduling Vertex AI pipelines

Read the documentation for scheduling Vertex AI pipelines ahead of working on the next step to better understand on-demand execution through a simpler example than the one in the lab.<br>

## 6. Cloud Function deployment pictorial overview

The Cloud Function is already deployed in your environment. The folowing is the author's deployment from the Terraform script. Yours should be identical.

## 7. Review of the Cloud Function code for executing the Vertex AI Spark ML Model Training Pipeline

### 7.1. What is happening inside the function?

### 7.3. Source code - requirements.txt

The latest requirements.txt is avialable here-<br>
https://github.com/anagha-google/s8s-spark-mlops/blob/main/02-scripts/cloud-functions/requirements.txt

### 7.4. Source code - main.py

## 8. Execute the Cloud Function and monitor for pipeline execution through completion
The Cloud Function is generation 2 and does not have a "click to test" button feature yet. We need to grab the command line execution from the UI and run it in Cloud Shell.

### 8.1. Grab the command for executing the Cloud Function

<br><br>

### 8.2. Run the command in Cloud Shell
![M6](../06-images/module-6-16.png)   
<br><br>

### 8.3. Monitor the Vertex AI pipeline for any errors
![M6](../06-images/module-6-17.png)   
<br><br>

### 8.4. Monitor the Dataproc Batches UI for new jobs
Follow at least a couple steps through completion.

### 8.5. Monitor the overall completion of the pipeline execution

This concludes the module. In the [next module](../05-lab-guide/Module-07-Schedule-VertexAI-Pipeline.md), we will create a Cloud Scheduler job for time based execution of the model training pipeline.
