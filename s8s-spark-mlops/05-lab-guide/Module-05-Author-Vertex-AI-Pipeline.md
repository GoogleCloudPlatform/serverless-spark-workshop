# About Module 5

In this module, we will author and test a Vertex AI pipeline to orchestrate the Spark ML model training and prepare for operationalizing the same. The module takes about two and half hours to complete, but you need to actually only spend about 40 minutes, the rest is execution time - waiting for completion.

## 4. About Vertex AI pipelines & support for Spark ML Models in Vertex AI platform
We will use Vertex AI User Managed Notebook environment for this exercise and this is already created for you. When you open JupyterLab, you will also see a pre-created, customized notebook to get quick-started with learning pipeline authoring.

### 4.1. Vertex AI pipelines - basics

Vertex AI Pipelines helps you to automate, monitor, and govern your ML systems by orchestrating your ML workflow in a serverless manner, and storing your workflow's artifacts using Vertex ML Metadata. By storing the artifacts of your ML workflow in Vertex ML Metadata, you can analyze the lineage of your workflow's artifacts â€” for example, an ML model's lineage may include the training data, hyperparameters, and code that were used to create the model.

Vertex AI Pipelines let you automate, monitor, and experiment with interdependent parts of a ML workflow. Vertex AI ML Pipelines are portable, scalable, and based on containers. Each individual part of your pipeline workflow (for example, creating a dataset or training a model) is defined by code. This code is referred to as a component. Each instance of a component is called a step.

## 5. Authoring and operationalizing Vertex AI pipelines

### 5.1. Authoring a pipeline in a notebook - what's involved

<br><br>

### 5.2. Taking a pipeline developed in a notebook to production - steps involved

![M5](../06-images/module-5-04.png)   
<br><br>

<hr>

## 6. Review and execute the pre-authored Vertex AI pipeline from the Jupyter notebook

### 6.1. Open the pipeline notebook

![M5](../06-images/module-5-06.png)   
<br><br>

![M5](../06-images/module-5-07.png)   
<br><br>

### 6.2. Install dependencies

Be sure to uncomment the cell that installs dependencies and restarts kernel, once and comment it back.

![M5](../06-images/module-5-08.png)   
<br><br>

### 6.3. Study the notebook
Read through the notebook before you run it.

- Note how it calls all the PySpark batch jobs we tested in module 3
- Note how it uses your network (instead of Vertex AI network)
- Note how it does not use caching at a task/component/step level and at a pipeline job level
- Note how it uses a custom pipeline name

### 6.4. Run the pipeline notebook in entirety

In section 7, a URL is output, click on it.

<br><br>

### 6.5. Study and monitor the pipeline execution between Vertex AI pipeline step and Dataproc Batches UI

Takes about ~an hour to complete. Toggle between the Vertex AI pipeline UI and Dataproc Batches UI to monitor to completion.

## 13. Study the pipeline JSON

![M5](../06-images/module-5-24.png)   
<br><br>

![M5](../06-images/module-5-25.png)   
<br><br>

Open the JSON and review all the nodes and elements in it. The runtime parameters at the very end of the JSON are most critical.

<hr>

## 14. Test the JSON via Vertex AI pipeline UI

- All the 3 PySpark jobs expect a pipeline ID parameter
- The pipeline ID is intended to be the same for lineage/traceability/versioning
- Notice that the pipeline JSON has the pipeline ID hardcoded from the execution via the notebook
- Download the JSON to your machine
- Lets upload it to the UI
- We will have to modify all the parameters where there is an existing pipeline ID. Lets replace with 123456 as the pipeline ID and run it
- Submit the pipeline via the UI after the notebook submission completes - you may not have enough compute cores for parallel runs although they wont clash whatsoever

## 15. Edit the JSON for on-demand REST calls & persist in GCS

- This step has been completed for you.
- The author has essentially replaced hard-coded values of pipeline ID from the authroing & execution via the notebook with a keyword that will be replaced with a runtime generated pipeline ID in the Cloud function
- The updated JSON for use with the Cloud Function is in your pipeline bucket inside the templates directory
- Note that your version of the pipeline JSON template has your project details - ID, number, your service account - completely customized

This concludes the module. In the [next module](../05-lab-guide/Module-06-Author-CloudFunction-For-Vertex-AI-Pipeline.md) you will create a Cloud Function to execute the Vertex AI Spark ML pipeline.
