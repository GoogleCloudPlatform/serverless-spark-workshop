# Retail store analytics using Serverless Spark, SparkSql and Metastore

Lab contributed by: [TEKsystems](https://www.teksystems.com/en/about-us/partnerships/google-cloud)

## Overview

With the advent of cloud environments, the concept of huge capital investments in infrastructure in terms of capital and maintenance is a thing of the past. Even when it comes to provisioning infrastructure on cloud services, it can get tedious and cumbersome.

In this example, you will look at executing a simple SparkSQL code which runs on Serverless batch (a fully managed Dataproc cluster). It is similar to executing code on a Dataproc cluster without the need to initialize, deploy or manage the underlying infrastructure.

This usecase deals with the analysis of retail store data.


## Services Used
* Google Cloud Storage
* Google Cloud Dataproc


## 3. Permissions / IAM Roles required to run the lab

Following permissions / roles are required to execute the serverless batch

- Viewer
- Dataproc Editor
- Service Account User
- Storage Admin

<br>

## 4. Checklist

To perform the lab, below are the list of activities to perform. <br>

[1. GCP Prerequisites](instructions/01-gcp-prerequisites.md)<br>
[2. Spark History Server Setup](instructions/02-persistent-history-server.md)<br>
[3. Uploading scripts and datasets to GCP](instructions/03-files-upload.md)<br>
[4. Metastore Creation](instructions/04-metastore-creation.md)<br>

Note down the values for below variables to get started with the lab:

```
PROJECT_ID=                                         #Current GCP project where we are building our use case
REGION=                                             #GCP region where all our resources will be created
SUBNET=                                             #subnet which has private google access enabled
BUCKET_CODE=                                        #GCP bucket where our code, data and model files will be stored
BUCKET_PHS=                                         #bucket where our application logs created in the history server will be stored
HISTORY_SERVER_NAME=                                #name of the history server which will store our application logs
UMSA=                                               #user managed service account required for the PySpark job executions
Metastore_name=                                      #Name of the metastore which will store our schema
SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$UMSA@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

## 5. Lab Modules

The lab consists of the following modules.

1. Understand the Data
2. Solution Architecture
3. Running the serverless batch
4. Examine the logs
5. Explore the output

There are 2 ways of perforing the lab.
- Using [Google Cloud Shell](instructions/05a-retail-store-analytics-gcloud-execution.md)
- Using [GCP console](instructions/05b-retail-store-analytics-console-execution.md )

Please chose one of the methods to execute the lab.
