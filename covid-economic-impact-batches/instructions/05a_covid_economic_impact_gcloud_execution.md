## 1. Understanding Data

## Data Files
The datasets used for this project are:
- stringency.csv: This file contains the Stringency Index of each country regarding the measures taken to fight covid-19.
- stock.csv: This file contains the stock market values of various companies from different countries.
 
 
 
![this is a screenshot of the source tables](../images/Source_tables.png)
 
 
 
The ETL flow processes the source data to generate multiple fact and dim tables:
 
 
 
- Fact table:
- Economic_status_table [ec_status_id, Date, country_code, stringency_index, stock_id, value_type, value]
- The fact table is created by joining the source stringency and stock table.
 
 
 
- Dimension tables:
- Time_table [Date, day, month, year, week_day]
- This dim table is created by extracting the time details from the stringency table
- Country_table [country_code, country_name]
- This table is created by extracting distinct country details from the stock table
- Company_table [stock_Id, company_name, sector]
- This table is created by extracting the stock and company details from the stock table
 
 
 
The data warehouse star schema would look like below:

## 3. Declaring cloud shell variables

#### 3.1 Set the PROJECT_ID in Cloud Shell

Open Cloud shell or navigate to [shell.cloud.google.com](https://shell.cloud.google.com)<br>
Run the below
```
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

```

#### 3.2 Verify the PROJECT_ID in Cloud Shell

Next, run the following command in cloud shell to ensure that the current project is set correctly:

```
gcloud config get-value project
```

#### 3.3 Declare the variables

Based on the prereqs and checklist, declare the following variables in cloud shell by replacing with your values:


```
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)       #current GCP project where we are building our use case
REGION=                                             #GCP region where all our resources will be created
SUBNET=                                             #subnet which has private google access enabled
BUCKET_CODE=                                        #GCP bucket where our code, data and model files will be stored
BUCKET_PHS=                                         #bucket where our application logs created in the history server will be stored
HISTORY_SERVER_NAME=                                #name of the history server which will store our application logs
BQ_DATASET_NAME=                                    #BigQuery dataset where all the tables will be stored
UMSA=serverless-spark                               #name of the user managed service account required for the PySpark job executions
SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$UMSA@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
NAME=                                               #Your unique identifier
```

**Note:** For all the variables except 'NAME', please ensure to use the values provided by the admin team.

<br>

### 3.4 Update Cloud Shell SDK version

Run the below on cloud shell-

```
gcloud components update

```

## 4. Execution 

### 4.2. Run PySpark Serverless Batch

Run the below on cloud shell -
```
gcloud dataproc batches submit \
  --project $PROJECT_ID \
  --region $REGION \
  pyspark --batch $NAME-batch-${RANDOM} \
  --version 1.1 \
  gs://$BUCKET_CODE/covid-economic-impact/00-scripts/covid_economic_impact_etl.py \
  --jars gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-with-dependencies_2.12-0.22.2.jar \
  --subnet $SUBNET \
  --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
  --history-server-cluster projects/$PROJECT_ID/regions/$REGION/clusters/$HISTORY_SERVER_NAME \
  -- $PROJECT_ID $BQ_DATASET_NAME $BUCKET_CODE $NAME
```


### 4.3. Check the output table in BigQuery

Navigate to BigQuery Console, and check the **covid_economic_impact** dataset. <br>
Once the data preparation batch is completed, four new tables '<your_name_here>_ec_status', '<your_name_here>_countries', '<your_name_here>_stocks' and '<your_name_here>_times' will be created :

To query the data to find the list of stocks with highest stringency Index, run the following query - 
```
  select * from `<GCP-PROJECT-NAME>.<BQ-DATASET-NAME>.<user_name>_ec_status` EC inner join `<GCP-PROJECT-NAME>.<BQ-DATASET-NAME>.<user_name>_stocks` S on EC.stock_id=S.stock_id where stringency_index=(select max(stringency_index) from `<GCP-PROJECT-NAME>.<BQ-DATASET-NAME>.<user_name>_ec_status`)
  
```

**Note:** Edit all occurrences of <GCP-PROJECT-NAME> and <BQ-DATASET-NAME> to match the values of the variables PROJECT_ID,user_name and BQ_DATASET_NAME respectively

## 5. Logging

### 5.1 Serverless Batch logs

Logs associated with the application can be found in the logging console under 
**Dataproc > Serverless > Batches > <batch_name>**. 
<br> You can also click on “View Logs” button on the Dataproc batches monitoring page to get to the logging page for the specific Spark job.
